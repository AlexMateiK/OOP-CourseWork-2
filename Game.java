/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "Hard work pays off" application.
 *  A simple game in which you have to do tasks to collect 30 pounds.
 *  The game is highly interactive and in order to win the player must chat with characters, help them, use items, collect items, etc.
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
