/**
 * 
 * 
 * This parser reads user input and tries to interpret it as an "Adventure"
 * command. Every time it is called it reads a line from the terminal and
 * tries to interpret the line as a three word command. It returns the command
 * as an object of class Command.
 *
 * The parser has a set of known command words. It checks user input against
 * the known commands, and if the input is not one of the known commands, it
 * returns a command object that is marked as an unknown command.
 * 
 * Later addition: The parser now has also uses an object of type MissionCommandWords
 * which contains commands added as part of tasks, which have no other functionality than
 * to be recognized in order to progress the game, but still need to be recognized 
 * in the same way.
