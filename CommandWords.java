    Value = name of command, always in english, used in the code
    to recognize command chosen by user and trigger it's effects.
    
    I have chosen this implementation in order to be able to add 
    any action/command to the game and have it be independent from
    a natural language, in the sense that only this map needs to be changed
    if a translation takes place.
    I prefer this over using an Enum type because it's easier to add commands on the fly.
