This project was done as part of the Programming Practice and Applications course
at King's College London. Some code belongs to the creators of the assignment, which
was provided as a starting point for my implementation. The code provided initially
was a more rudimentary form of the parser, which allowed the player's move commands
to impact the state of the game. All other additions are my own unless specified
explicitly in the specific source code file.
